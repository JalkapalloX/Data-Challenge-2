FIRST CLIENT MEETING NOTES

- Why are there so many 0's?
- Some numbers don't make sense -> more unique users buying after clicking than buying
- Buyer bids are often 0
- campaign_id, device_type, operating_system are not unique identifiers?
- Duplicated rows?
- conversion rates are unintuitive (too high)

any duplicated campaign id's?

Is impressions the better indicator than unique user impressions for buyer bid?
Are there similar campaigns with different creative sizes (or other properties)? Do they have a
significant difference in outcomes?

Advertiser may go for brand recognition? When?

PUBLISHER
- goals: more money

ADVERTISERS
- What should be the properties of ads?

AGENCIES
- How well do we achieve advertisers goal with given budget?
- How efficient was agencies work?
- Agencies organize campaigns
- Which campaign times are better?

CONSUMER
- Say you consider only customers who like big brothers
- STUDY ON HOW PEOPLE HATE PERSONALIZED ADVERTISEMENTS

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
~~~ OBSERVATIONS ~~~
- A few lines are missing any values.
- Lots of 0's seem unexplained (e.g. having 9000 clicks but 0 inview ads)
- Many cases just have group A or B, not A and B
- Some buyer bids are 0.
- We cannot always backtrack individual A/B-tests and compare them because multiple may be going on at the same time.
